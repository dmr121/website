  about: |
    I like to make frontend applications whether it's for iOS with Apple's SwiftUI framework or a Vue app accessible via browser. As I have always been a visual person, frontend development fits naturally with my interests. I have a passion for simply designed apps combined with an aesthetic UI and straightforward functionality.

    I have some recent experience working as a consultant for 2 local companies, Bamboo Software and SkyCatchFire, doing both frontend and backend things. Primariliy, my roles have been confined to upgrading or adding features to exisiting iOS applications.

    Even more recently, I have taken a greater interest in web development, specifically with the progressive web app framework called Vue. It is a natural extension of my skills as this is not my first time working with a reactive framework and also a component-based framework like Vue before.

    I like to make iOS applicatinos primarily using Apple's SwiftUI framework. I have a passion
    for simply designed apps combined with an aesthetic UI and straightforward functionality.

    Though app development is my focus right now, I am open to many different fields of work as I
    believe in constantly working to improve myself and expand my skill set.

  skills:
    - C++
    - Python
    - Swift / SwiftUI
  tools:
    - Xcode
    - GitHub
    - Sublime
